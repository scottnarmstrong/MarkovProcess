# Dense-time approximation from above

Every nonnegative real time is the limit of a strictly decreasing sequence of dense times whose
physical values stay strictly above the limit. This includes time zero and times that already
belong to the dense carrier; choosing strict upper approximants gives one uniform API for all
cuts.

This is deterministic order-topological infrastructure and makes no stochastic-process claim.
