# Measurability of the state at a stopping time

The coordinate process of canonical continuous-path space is adapted to the canonical filtration
and continuous in time, hence progressively measurable.  Consequently the state at a finite
stopping time is measurable for the stopped sigma-algebra.  No countable-range premise is used.
Plain Borel measurability of the same map, under weaker assumptions, is in
`Path/RandomShiftMeasurability.lean`.

This is ordinary measurability infrastructure.  It proves no restart identity and no conditional
expectation formula; those are in `Trajectory/FellerStoppingRestart.lean` and
`Trajectory/FellerStoppingConditional.lean`.
