# Deterministic shifts of continuous paths

This file defines translation by a fixed nonnegative time on canonical continuous-path space.
The shift is jointly continuous in the shift time and path for the compact-open topology.  It also
records the corresponding deterministic relation between the canonical filtrations.

No random-time shift, Markov property, strong Markov property, or Hunt-process assertion is made.
