# Exit times of open sets on continuous-path space

For an open set `U` this file studies `ContinuousPath.exitTime U`, the first time a continuous
path leaves `U`, in the `WithTop`-valued form `ContinuousPath.exitTimeTop U` demanded by
Mathlib's stopping-time convention.  The three consumer facts are: the exit time is a stopping
time for the canonical filtration; it is finite exactly when the path leaves `U` at some time,
and at a finite exit time the path sits on the frontier of `U` when it started inside; and its
truncation `exitTimeTrunc U K` at a deterministic horizon is an `NNReal`-valued stopping time,
which is the form the finite-stopping-time API of this library consumes.

The route is the closed-set detection of `Path/ClosedSetDetection.lean`: the event
`{exitTime ≤ t}` is the event of hitting the closed set `Uᶜ` by time `t`, because a path that
stays in the open set `U` throughout `[0, t]` stays in it slightly beyond `t`.

This file constructs no probability law and proves no probabilistic statement; in particular it
does not claim that the exit time is almost surely finite for any process.
