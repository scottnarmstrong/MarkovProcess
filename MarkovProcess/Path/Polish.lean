# Polish structure of continuous-path space

For a complete separable metric state space, the compact-open topology on continuous paths is
Polish: it is second countable, and it is induced by the compact-convergence uniformity, which is
complete and countably generated because nonnegative time is locally compact and sigma-compact.
With the Borel sigma-algebra the path space is therefore a standard Borel space.

This is ordinary topological infrastructure.  It proves no probabilistic statement.
