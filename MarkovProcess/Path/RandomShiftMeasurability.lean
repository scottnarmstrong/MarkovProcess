# Measurability of random shifts of continuous paths

Shifting a continuous path by a Borel measurable random time, and evaluating it at that time,
are Borel measurable, because the deterministic shift and the evaluation are jointly continuous
in the time and the path.  A finite `NNReal`-valued stopping time for the canonical filtration is
such a random time.  No countable-range premise is used.

This is ordinary measurability infrastructure.  It proves no restart identity and no conditional
expectation formula; those are in `Trajectory/FellerStoppingRestart.lean` and
`Trajectory/FellerStoppingConditional.lean`.
