# Continuous extension from dense-time paths

This file embeds ordinary continuous paths into paths on the fixed dense time carrier. It proves
that the image is measurable and supplies a measurable total inverse. The inverse is the genuine
continuous extension on the image and is arbitrarily equal to a caller-supplied default path away
from the image.

No probability law is shown to be supported on this image, and no continuous modification,
stochastic-process association, or path-regularity claim is made here.
