# Continuous support from a continuous modification

This file turns a continuous-time modification of the coordinate process of a dense-time law
into almost-sure support on restrictions of continuous paths. The only measure-theoretic step is
the simultaneous choice of all dense-time modification identities, which is valid because
`DenseTime` is countable.

The continuous modification itself is not constructed here: it is the Kolmogorov--Chentsov
argument of `Continuity/GlobalDyadicFloorModification.lean`, applied to dense-time trajectory
kernels in `Continuity/KolmogorovDenseTimeContinuousSupport.lean`.

/-- A continuous-time modification of every coordinate law implies that the original dense-time
law is almost surely the restriction of a continuous path. The modification may depend on the
kernel parameter `b`; no measurable choice of modifications in `b` is required for this
pointwise support conclusion. -/
