# The killed parameterized family

For a measurably parameterized family of conservative Feller semigroups and an open set `U`, the
processes of the fibres killed when they leave `U` again form a measurably parameterized family
of sub-Markov kernel semigroups on the carrier `U`: `killedFamily P hP U hU hFeller hK :
ParameterizedSubMarkovKernelSemigroup Theta U`, whose fibre at `theta` is the killed semigroup
`killedSemigroup` of `Killed/Semigroup.lean` for the semigroup at `theta`
(`killedFamily_toSubMarkovKernelSemigroup`, definitionally).  The only new content is the joint
measurability of the killed transition probabilities in the parameter, the time and the starting
point, `measurable_killedKernelOn_family`, which comes from the joint measurability of the
parameterized continuous-path process through the fibre identity.

The killed process on lifetime paths (with a cemetery state) is not constructed here.
