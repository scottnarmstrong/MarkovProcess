# Joint regularity of strongly continuous semigroups on `C₀`

Strong continuity of a semigroup orbit in the `C₀` norm and continuity of
evaluation give continuity, jointly in time and state, of the evaluated orbit.
The corresponding Borel measurability statement follows without any additional
regularity premise on the semigroup.

This is a generic functional-analytic API. It makes no representation claim
about the semigroup.
