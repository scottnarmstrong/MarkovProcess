# Uniqueness for resolvents on bounded measurable functions

This file proves three elementary contraction principles for maps acting on bounded measurable
real functions. The first gives uniqueness for a bounded multiplicative perturbation equation.
The second propagates equality of two resolvent families from all sufficiently large shifts to
every positive shift by the resolvent identity. The third combines the first two principles.

Main results: `perturbed_unique`, `resolventFamily_eq_of_eventually`, and
`perturbed_eq_of_resolventFamilies`.

The operators are plain maps on functions; no Banach-space carrier or continuity is asserted.

/-- **Uniqueness for a bounded perturbation equation.**  Suppose `R` is additive on bounded
measurable functions and has the uniform bound `|R f x| ≤ D / λ` whenever `|f| ≤ D`.  If
`0 ≤ q ≤ C` and `C < λ`, then two maps preserving bounded measurable functions and solving
`Z f = R f - R (q * Z f)` agree on every bounded measurable function.

At a fixed sufficiently large shift, this gives the bounded-measurable equality needed by
`resolventFamily_eq_of_eventually`.  The `Nonempty alpha` assumption is used to extract
`0 ≤ C` and nonnegativity of bounds from their pointwise hypotheses. -/

/-- **Equality of resolvent families from equality at large shifts.**  Let `X` and `Y` be
families of maps on bounded measurable real functions. Suppose `X` is additive and satisfies the
bound `|X_λ f| ≤ D / λ`, while both families preserve measurability and boundedness. If both
satisfy the resolvent identity and agree on bounded measurable functions above a fixed threshold,
then they agree on bounded measurable functions at every positive shift.

The large-shift equality need only hold at the bounded measurable arguments used by the proof. -/
