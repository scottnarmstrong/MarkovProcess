# Sub-Markov transition-kernel semigroups

This file packages jointly measurable, nonnegative-time transition kernels with
the Chapman--Kolmogorov law.  Mathlib writes `η.comp κ` for first applying `κ`
and then `η`; consequently the law below is `K (s + t) = (K t).comp (K s)`.

Conservativity is deliberately a separate predicate.  A killed transition
family has mass at most one, while a conservative family has mass exactly one.

/-- A jointly measurable sub-Markov transition-kernel semigroup.

The measurability field is joint in time and starting point.  The composition
orientation agrees with the convention that the operator associated with a
kernel `K` sends `f` to `x ↦ ∫ y, f y ∂K x`.
