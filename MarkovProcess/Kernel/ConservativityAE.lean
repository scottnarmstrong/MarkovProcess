# Conservativity from preservation of constants

This file extracts the measure-theoretic conservativity consequence of an
associated `L∞` operator that preserves the constant-one class.  The conclusion
is initially almost everywhere in the starting point.  Continuity of the
transition mass and positivity of the reference measure on nonempty open sets
upgrade it to pointwise conservativity.
