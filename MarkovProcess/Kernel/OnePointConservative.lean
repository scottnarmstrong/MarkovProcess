# A conservative resolvent keeps the compactified process in the live space

The Laplace transform of the finite exit time from the live part of the compactification is one
minus the shift times the kernel resolvent of the constant observable one
(`Kernel/OnePointKilled.lean`).  When that product is one, the transform vanishes, so the exit
time is almost surely infinite: the compactified process started at a live point almost surely
never reaches the added point
(`PositiveC0ContractiveResolvent.OnePointRegular.ae_exitTime_eq_top`).  No kernel into the
continuous paths of the live space is produced here; the statement is about the law of the
compactified process.

The regularity data of the compactification are an explicit hypothesis, as everywhere the
continuous-path process is formed.

/-- **A conservative resolvent leaves no escape.**  If at one positive shift the shift times the
kernel resolvent of the constant observable one is one at a live starting point, then the
compactified process started there almost surely never leaves the live space. -/
