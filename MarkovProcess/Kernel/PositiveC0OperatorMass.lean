# Total mass of pointwise Riesz measures

A positive contraction on real continuous functions vanishing at infinity induces pointwise
Riesz measures of total mass at most one.  The proof first bounds compact sets using compactly
supported Urysohn cutoff functions, then passes to the whole space by inner regularity.

This file proves only a pointwise total-mass bound and finiteness.  It does not construct a kernel
or prove any regularity in the evaluation point.
