# Continuity of semigroup orbits from continuity at zero

For a contractive semigroup, strong convergence to the identity at time zero
propagates to continuity of every orbit at every nonnegative time.  Contractivity also upgrades
strong continuity to joint continuity in the time and the vector, in the form
`continuous_operator_apply`.
