# Equibounded strong convergence is uniform on compact sets

A family of continuous linear operators whose operator norms share one common bound and which
converges to zero at every point converges to zero uniformly on every compact set.  The common
bound makes the family equi-Lipschitz, so a finite `δ`-net of the compact set reduces the uniform
assertion to finitely many pointwise ones.

Main results: `eventually_forall_mem_norm_apply_le_of_isCompact`.

Neither completeness of the spaces nor countable generation of the index filter is used, and
nothing is asserted about convergence in the operator norm, which is strictly stronger.

/-- **Equibounded strong convergence to zero is uniform on compact sets.**  If the operators
`T i` share the bound `‖T i‖ ≤ C` and `T i x → 0` for every vector `x`, then for every compact
set `K` and every `ε > 0` the estimate `‖T i x‖ ≤ ε` holds for all `x ∈ K` simultaneously,
eventually along the index filter. -/
