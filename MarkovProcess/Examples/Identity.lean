# The identity semigroup and its continuous-path process

The transition semigroup that never moves: `idSemigroup t = Kernel.id` at every time.  It is
conservative, Feller, and satisfies the Kolmogorov moment criterion with exponents `p = 1`,
`q = 2` and constant `M = 0`, so the existence-and-uniqueness theorem of `MarkovProcess.Main`
applies to it verbatim.  The resulting process is identified: from every starting point `x` its
law is the Dirac mass at the constant path at `x`.

This file witnesses that the hypotheses of the main theorem are jointly satisfiable; it proves
nothing about any other semigroup, and it makes no claim about a semigroup that actually moves
(see `MarkovProcess.Examples.Drift` for that).
