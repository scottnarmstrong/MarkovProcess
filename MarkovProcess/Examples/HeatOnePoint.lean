# The compactified heat process

The heat resolvent represents the heat semigroup again
(`kernelSemigroup_heatResolvent`), so its one-point extension moves a live starting point by the
Gaussian law and never reaches the added point.  In the metric determined by the exhaustion
`x ↦ 1 / (1 + |x|)` the distance of two points is at most `2` and the distance of two live points
is at most their distance on the line, so the fourth-moment estimate of the Gaussian law gives
the local Kolmogorov criterion on the compactification
(`hasLocalKolmogorovMoments_onePointKernelSemigroup_heatResolvent`).

This assembles the regularity data from which the continuous-path process of the compactified
heat semigroup is formed (`onePointRegular_heatResolvent`), the witness that those data are
available for a genuine example.  Because the heat semigroup is conservative, the compactified
process started at a live point almost surely never reaches the added point
(`ae_exitTime_eq_top_heatResolvent`).
