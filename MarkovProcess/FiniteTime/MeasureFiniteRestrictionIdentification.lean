# Identifying measures from finite-coordinate restrictions

A finite measure on a product space is determined by all of its finite-coordinate pushforwards.
The empty coordinate set is part of the family and therefore records the total mass; measures of
unequal mass cannot satisfy the hypothesis.

This is generic measure-theoretic infrastructure and requires no topology.
