# Restricting normalized coordinate products to active coordinates

This file enumerates the active coordinates of a normalized `CoordinateProductTerm`, extracts
their genuine `C₀` factors, and proves that evaluation factors through the corresponding
coordinate restriction.  The restricting function is definitionally the same path operation as
`FiniteOrderedTimes.restrictPath (activeOrderEmbedding factors)` when that finite-time API is in
scope.

If there are no active coordinates, the reduced index type is `Fin 0` and the empty scalar
product is one.  No constant-one element of `C₀` is constructed.  This is purely algebraic
finite-product infrastructure: it involves no measure and no kernel.
