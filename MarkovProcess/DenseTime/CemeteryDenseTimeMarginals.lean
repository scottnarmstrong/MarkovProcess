# Cemetery marginals of dense-time trajectories

For a conservative live semigroup, the trajectory of its cemetery extension has no cemetery mass
at any dense-time coordinate when started from a live state.  This is a finite-coordinate statement;
it does not assert that a dense-time path has a continuous lifetime-path extension.
