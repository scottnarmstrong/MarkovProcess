# Exit times of lifetime paths

This file defines the first time at which a lifetime path is not a live point of a prescribed
set. Reaching the cemetery state counts as exit. The infimum of the empty set is infinity, so a
path which never exits has infinite exit time.

Only deterministic order properties are proved here. No measurability or stopping-time claim is
made.
