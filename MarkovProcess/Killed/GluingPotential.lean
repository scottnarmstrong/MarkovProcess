# Potential measures

The resolvent of a transition family at a shift `lam` integrates an observable against the
exponentially weighted time average of its transition kernels.  This file realises that average
as a genuine measure, the `lam`-potential measure

  `laplacePotential lam mu = ∫_0^∞ e^{-lam t} (mu t) dt`,

so that both the kernel resolvent of a sub-Markov kernel semigroup and the killed resolvent of an
open set are integrals against a measure on the state space:
`SubMarkovKernelSemigroup.lintegral_resolventPotential` and
`IsConservative.lintegral_killedPotential`.  Potential measures of sub-Markov families are finite
at every positive shift, with total mass at most `1 / lam`.

Two consequences of the measure form are proved here: the killed resolvent is monotone in the
open set and in the observable (`IsConservative.killedResolvent_mono`), and the kernel resolvent
is measurable in the starting point and continuous along monotone limits of observables
(`SubMarkovKernelSemigroup.measurable_kernelResolvent`,
`SubMarkovKernelSemigroup.kernelResolvent_iSup`).  The kernel resolvent is also additive and
homogeneous on measurable observables (`SubMarkovKernelSemigroup.kernelResolvent_add`,
`SubMarkovKernelSemigroup.kernelResolvent_const_mul`).

No resolvent identity and no topology on the state space are used here.
