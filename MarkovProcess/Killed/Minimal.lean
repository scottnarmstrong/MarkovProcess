# The semigroup as the limit of its killed parts

Along an open exhaustion `U n ↑ α` of the state space, the killed kernels increase to the
transition kernels of the semigroup: for every time `t`, starting point `x` and measurable set
`B`,

  `⨆ n, killedKernel P hP (U n) _ t x B = P t x B`   (`iSup_killedKernel_apply`),

and the survival probabilities `Q x {t < τ_{U n}}` increase to one. This is the statement that the
whole-space semigroup is the minimal semigroup of its killed parts; it rests on the path-space
fact that exit times along an exhaustion tend to infinity (`Path/Exhaustion.lean`), so the
killed events increase to the whole event `{ω t ∈ B}`.

The killed kernels are monotone in the open set (`killedKernel_mono`); no other structure is
used.
