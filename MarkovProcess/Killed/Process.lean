# The process killed at the exit of an open set, as a law on lifetime paths

For the continuous-path process `Q = continuousProcess P hP` of a conservative semigroup and an
open set `U`, killing each path at its exit time from `U` produces a Markov kernel

  `killedProcess P hP U hU : Kernel U (LifetimePath U)`,

the law of the process started inside `U` and sent to the cemetery when it leaves `U`.  It is the
image of `Q` under `ContinuousPath.killAtExit U`, pulled back to the carrier `U`.

Two marginals are identified here.  The lifetime of the killed process is the exit time
(`killedProcess_map_lifetime`), and its coordinate at a fixed time is the cemetery extension of
the killed transition kernel on `U` (`killedProcess_map_coordinate`): the live part is
`killedKernelOn P hP U hU t x` and the cemetery carries exactly the mass lost by time `t`.

No finite-dimensional distribution of the killed process is identified here, and no Feller or
regularity property of the killed family is claimed.
