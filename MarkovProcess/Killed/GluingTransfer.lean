# From vanishing observables to measurable ones

An identity between a measure `nu` on a target space and a measure `mu` on a source space,
tested on observables which are supported in the range of a measurable embedding `i` and
extended by zero off it, propagates from continuous observables vanishing at infinity to all
nonnegative measurable observables
(`lintegral_extend_eq_of_forall_zeroAtInfty`).  The reason is that both sides are integrals
against finite Borel measures on the source space, and continuous observables with compact
support already separate finite Borel measures on a locally compact second-countable metric
space.

This is the bridge which upgrades an analytically supplied identity of resolvents, stated for
continuous observables vanishing at infinity, to the identity of the corresponding potential
measures.

No topology on the target space is used, and no relation between the two measures other than the
tested identity is assumed.
