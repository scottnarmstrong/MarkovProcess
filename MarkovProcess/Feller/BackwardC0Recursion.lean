# Backward `C₀` recursion for finite Feller transitions

An ordered nonempty family of one-coordinate `C₀` factors determines a backward semigroup
recursion: evolve the last factors relative to the first time, multiply by the first factor, and
then evolve from the starting state to the first time.  The recursion varies continuously in the
`C₀` norm when every ordered observation time converges.

This file contains only the analytic recursion and its continuity.  Its identification with an
integral against a finite-time kernel is in `Feller/BackwardC0Integral.lean`; no statement about
path space is proved here.
