# Continuity of finite-set compact-test integrals

Compact-test integrals against a conservative Feller semigroup's finite-set kernel vary
continuously with the starting point. The proof transports the test to increasing coordinates
and applies fixed-time finite-kernel continuity. The empty finite set is included without a
separate nonemptiness assumption.

This is finite-dimensional analytic infrastructure; no statement about path space is proved
here.  The continuous-path process is built in `Trajectory/`.
