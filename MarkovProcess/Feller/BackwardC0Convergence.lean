# Convergence of the backward `C₀` recursion along a family of semigroups

The backward recursion of `Feller/BackwardC0Recursion.lean` evolves a nonempty ordered family of
one-coordinate `C₀` factors through the transitions of one Feller kernel semigroup.  Here the
family of times and the factors are held fixed and the *semigroup* varies along a filter: if the
`C₀` semigroups converge strongly, so does the backward recursion, in the `C₀` norm.  The
induction is one line per step: contractivity makes the outer transition insensitive to the
error accumulated by the inner one.

Since the `C₀` norm is the supremum norm, this is exactly convergence of the coordinate-product
integrals against the finite-time kernels, uniformly in the starting point.

Main results: `tendsto_backwardC0_of_tendsto_c0Semigroup`,
`tendstoUniformly_integral_coordinateProduct_finiteTimeKernel`.

The factors and the observation times are fixed; nothing is asserted when they vary along the
filter as well, and no rate of convergence is claimed.

/-- **Strong convergence of the `C₀` semigroups propagates through the backward recursion.**
For a fixed nonempty ordered family of times and fixed one-coordinate factors, the backward
recursions of a family of Feller kernel semigroups converge in the `C₀` norm to the backward
recursion of the limit semigroup. -/
