# Weak continuity of the path law in the starting point

`Trajectory/StartingPointContinuity.lean` proves that cylinder expectations of the
continuous-path process depend continuously on the starting point.  This file upgrades that to
*every* bounded continuous functional of the path, which is weak continuity of the path law
itself.

The route needs no compactness theorem for measures.  Fix a starting point `x0` and a compact
neighbourhood `K0` of it.  Tightness (`Trajectory/PathTightness.lean`) produces one compact set of
paths carrying all but `eta` of the mass from every starting point of `K0`.  On that compact set
Stone--Weierstrass replaces the given functional by a bounded cylinder functional, with a norm
bound that makes the discarded mass cheap (`Trajectory/CylinderAlgebra.lean`), and the cylinder
functional is already known to have continuous expectations.  Three epsilons and a triangle
inequality finish the argument.

Main results:

* `IsFellerKernelSemigroup.continuous_integral_boundedCylinder`, continuity for cylinder
  functionals;
* `IsFellerKernelSemigroup.continuous_integral_continuousProcess`, continuity for every bounded
  continuous functional of the path;
* `IsConservative.pathLaw` and `IsFellerKernelSemigroup.continuous_pathLaw`, the same statement
  read as continuity into the space of probability measures on path space with its topology of
  convergence in distribution.

Nothing here asserts relative compactness of a family of laws, and no convergence of a sequence
of semigroups is treated.

/-- **Weak continuity of the path law in the starting point.**  For a conservative Feller
semigroup on a proper metric state space satisfying the intrinsic Kolmogorov moment criterion, the
expectation of *every* bounded continuous functional of the path is a continuous function of the
starting point.

This extends the cylinder-expectation continuity of
`continuous_integral_finsetEvaluation_continuousProcess` to all of path space.  The proof is the
direct one: tightness over a compact neighbourhood of the reference point produces a compact set
of paths carrying all but a prescribed mass, Stone--Weierstrass replaces the functional by a
bounded cylinder functional on that compact set, and the cylinder case is already known.  No
compactness theorem for measures is used. -/
