# Measurable and continuous dependence on the starting point

Two regularity statements for the continuous-path process of a conservative sub-Markov kernel
semigroup, both in the starting point.

*Measurability.*  For a strongly measurable functional `F` of the path, the expectation
`x ↦ ∫ F d(continuousProcess P hP x)` is strongly measurable, hence measurable into a Borel
target: `IsConservative.stronglyMeasurable_integral_continuousProcess` and
`IsConservative.measurable_integral_continuousProcess`.  The same holds for the two functionals
that the strong Markov property produces, the shifted path and the state at a finite stopping
time: `IsConservative.measurable_integral_shift_stoppingTime_continuousProcess` and
`IsConservative.measurable_integral_eval_stoppingTime_continuousProcess`.

*Continuity.*  For a Feller semigroup the finite-dimensional laws depend weakly continuously on
the starting point: `IsFellerKernelSemigroup.continuous_integral_boundedContinuous_finiteSetKernel`
upgrades compact-test continuity to all bounded continuous test functions.  The
upgrade is a tightness argument: a finite-dimensional law on a Polish coordinate space is tight,
so a compactly supported continuous cutoff `g` with `1_K ≤ g ≤ 1` captures all but `epsilon` of the
mass at the reference starting point, the truncated integral `∫ f * g` is continuous by the
compact-test theorem, and the discarded part is bounded by `‖f‖ * (1 - ∫ g)`, itself continuous
and small.  On the process this reads as continuity of cylinder expectations,
`IsFellerKernelSemigroup.continuous_integral_finsetEvaluation_continuousProcess`, with the
one-time case `IsFellerKernelSemigroup.continuous_integral_eval_continuousProcess`.

Nothing here asserts weak continuity of the full path law `x ↦ continuousProcess P hP x` on path
space; that needs tightness on path space itself, which is not proved here.  No statement covers
a stopping time that can be infinite.

/-- **Weak continuity of the finite-dimensional laws in the starting point.**  For a conservative
Feller semigroup on a locally compact Polish state space, the integral of a *bounded continuous*
test function against the finite-set kernel `finiteSetKernel P I` is a continuous function of the
starting point.

The compact-test version
`IsFellerKernelSemigroup.continuous_integral_compactlySupported_finiteSetKernel` only sees
compactly supported tests; conservativity supplies the missing total mass one, and tightness of
the finite-dimensional law at the reference point turns vague continuity into weak continuity. -/
