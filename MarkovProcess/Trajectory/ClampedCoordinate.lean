# Measurability of clamped path coordinates

This file records the joint measurability of a continuous-path coordinate whose time argument is
clamped at a deterministic horizon.  It is the common progressive-measurability input for
adapted integral functionals.

Main result: `ContinuousPath.measurable_clampedCoordinate`.

No stochastic-process law or stopping-time identity is asserted.
