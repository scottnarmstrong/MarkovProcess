# Tightness of the path laws of a continuous-path Markov process

The modulus estimate of `Trajectory/PathModulus.lean` is uniform in the starting point, and the
process starts where it is told, so the laws `continuousProcess P hP x` for `x` in a compact set
of starting points satisfy both hypotheses of the Arzelà--Ascoli tightness criterion of
`Continuity/PathTightness.lean`.  This file records the resulting tightness statement.

Tightness is asserted for the starting points ranging over a *compact* set.  Over all starting
points at once it is false in general already at time zero: the time-zero laws are the Dirac
measures `delta_x`, and `{delta_x : x ∈ alpha}` is tight exactly when `alpha` is compact.  A compact set of starting points is also all that weak continuity in the
starting point needs, since continuity at a point only sees a neighbourhood of it.

The state space is assumed *proper* (closed balls are compact).  This is what discharges the
compact containment condition: the modulus confines a path to a bounded neighbourhood of its
starting point, and over a proper space bounded closed sets are compact.  On a general complete
separable metric state space the compact containment condition has to be supplied separately;
`ContinuousPath.isCompact_moduliSet_of_forall_isCompact` is the interface for that.

Main results:

* `IsConservative.measure_eval_zero_notMem_eq_zero`, the process starts where it is told;
* `IsConservative.isTightMeasureSet_continuousProcess`, tightness of the path laws over a compact
  set of starting points;
* `IsConservative.exists_isCompact_measure_compl_le`, the same in epsilon form.

No compactness theorem for measures (Prokhorov's theorem) is proved or used, and no weak
convergence statement is made here.

/-- **Tightness of the path laws over a compact set of starting points.**  For a conservative
semigroup on a proper metric state space satisfying the intrinsic Kolmogorov moment criterion, the
family `{continuousProcess P hP x : x ∈ K0}` of laws on continuous-path space is tight whenever
`K0` is compact.

The two inputs are the modulus estimate `exists_measure_compl_modulusSet_le`, whose scale does not
depend on the starting point, and the fact that the process starts in `K0`. -/
